## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone or download the repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd reddit-persona-generator
```

2. **Install required dependencies**
```bash
pip install requests
```

```

## üíª Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python reddit_persona_generator.py <reddit_profile_url>
```

### Examples with Sample URLs

```bash
# Analyze the first sample user
python reddit_persona_generator.py https://www.reddit.com/user/kojied/

# Analyze the second sample user  
python reddit_persona_generator.py https://www.reddit.com/user/Hungry-Move-6603/

# Specify custom output filename
python reddit_persona_generator.py https://www.reddit.com/user/kojied/ -o my_analysis.txt

# Limit analysis to 50 posts/comments
python reddit_persona_generator.py https://www.reddit.com/user/kojied/ -l 50
```

### Command Line Options

- `profile_url` (required): Reddit user profile URL
- `-o, --output`: Custom output filename (default: username_persona.txt)  
- `-l, --limit`: Limit number of posts/comments to analyze (default: 100)
- `-h, --help`: Show help message

### Supported URL Formats

The script accepts various Reddit URL formats:
```
https://www.reddit.com/user/username/
https://reddit.com/user/username
https://www.reddit.com/u/username/
https://reddit.com/u/username
```

## üìä Output Format

The script generates a comprehensive text file containing:

1. **User Overview** - Basic statistics and most active subreddits
2. **Demographics** - Age, location, occupation indicators  
3. **Interests & Hobbies** - Technology, gaming, fitness, entertainment, etc.
4. **Personality Traits** - Communication style, sentiment analysis
5. **Communication Style** - Tone, formality, engagement patterns
6. **Lifestyle Preferences** - Health, food, travel, home preferences
7. **Values & Beliefs** - Privacy, environment, community orientation
8. **Online Behavior** - Posting patterns, content reception
9. **Technical Proficiency** - Programming languages, tools, concepts
10. **Citations & Evidence** - Source links and evidence for all claims

## üîß Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **URL Parsing**: Extracts username from various Reddit URL formats
2. **Data Scraping**: Uses Reddit's JSON API to fetch user posts and comments
3. **Content Analysis**: Applies pattern matching and keyword analysis
4. **Persona Generation**: Categorizes findings into persona dimensions
5. **Citation Tracking**: Records evidence sources for all characteristics
6. **Output Formatting**: Generates structured, readable text reports

### API Usage

- Uses Reddit's public JSON endpoints (no authentication required)
- Respects rate limits with built-in delays
- Handles various error conditions gracefully
- Works with publicly available data only

### Data Analysis Methods

- **Keyword Pattern Matching**: Identifies interests and technical skills
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes positive/negative language patterns  
- **Activity Pattern Analysis**: Studies posting frequency and engagement
- **Subreddit Participation**: Maps activity to interest categories
- **Communication Style Analysis**: Evaluates formality and tone

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "No data found for user"**
- User may have deleted their account
- User may have no public posts/comments
- User profile may be private or suspended

**2. "Could not extract username from URL"**
- Check URL format is correct
- Ensure URL contains valid Reddit username
- Try different URL format variations

**3. "Error fetching data"**  
- Check internet connection
- Reddit may be temporarily unavailable
- Rate limiting may be in effect (wait and retry)

**4. "Permission denied" when saving file**
- Check write permissions in current directory
- Specify different output location with -o flag

### Rate Limiting

- Script includes automatic delays between requests
- If you hit rate limits, wait a few minutes and retry
- For multiple analyses, add delays between executions

### Debug Mode

Add print statements or modify the script to enable debug output:
```python
# Add after line imports
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## üìÅ Sample Output Files

This repository includes sample output files:

- `kojied_persona.txt` - Analysis of https://www.reddit.com/user/kojied/
- `Hungry-Move-6603_persona.txt` - Analysis of https://www.reddit.com/user/Hungry-Move-6603/

These demonstrate the expected output format and analysis depth.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal & Ethical Considerations

- **Public Data Only**: Only analyzes publicly available Reddit posts/comments
- **No Authentication**: Does not require login or access private data
- **Respectful Usage**: Includes rate limiting to avoid overloading Reddit's servers
- **Educational Purpose**: Designed for learning and analysis, not harassment
- **No Data Storage**: Does not store user data beyond the generated report

## üìù Code Quality

- **PEP-8 Compliant**: Follows Python style guidelines
- **Type Hints**: Uses Python type hints for better code documentation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns across classes
- **Documentation**: Well-documented with docstrings and comments

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

- **Advanced NLP**: Integration with NLTK or spaCy for better text analysis
- **Machine Learning**: Use trained models for personality prediction
- **Visualization**: Generate charts and graphs for persona data
- **Multiple Users**: Batch processing of multiple users
- **Export Formats**: Support for JSON, CSV, PDF outputs
- **Web Interface**: Create web-based version of the tool
